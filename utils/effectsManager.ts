/**
 * Algorithmic Visual Evolution - Effects Manager
 * 
 * Manages special visual effects and transitions in the simulation:
 * - Handles bursts, pulses, and other dynamic visual events
 * - Controls timing and intensity of effects
 * - Provides transition effects between states
 * - Coordinates with main algorithms to create visual interest
 * - Applies effects based on system state and user interactions
